//for this lab, the variable or object we are measuring by place/city (From Lab instructions- "Each location will be responsible for generating sales data")

//1. Store the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties.

//3. Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated.
//4. Store the results for each location in a separate arrayâ€¦ perhaps as a property of the object representing that location.
//5. Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser.
